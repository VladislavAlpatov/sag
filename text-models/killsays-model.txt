That's a win for me, catmigo!
Death keeps chasing me, but I keep him in my rearview.
Do you feel that adrenaline surging through your veins? ..No? Just me?
Don't worry, I've got a prosthetics guy who can replace, well, everything.
Down low, too slow.
I'd say eat my dust, but.. you're already dead, catmigo.
The stories got it wrong. Hare crushes tortoise, every time.
How awesome was that rush!? For me, I mean. For you? Not so much.
I could do this all day.
I could run circles around you all day.
Oh man! I hope I got all that on camera.
Oh, that was incredible! ..Okay. I'm bored now.
Man, that was intense! I'm gonna go run a victory lap!
I'm quick, and you're dead!
%name%, it's not about how hard you tried. It's about who wins.
%name%, it's a lot easier to stay alive if you actually run!
%name%, maybe lay off caffeine, huh?
You didn't even look like you were having fun. Come on, lighten up, %name%!
Never saw me coming, didja? It's cool. They never do.
Next time, give me a challenge!
Not too quick on the uptake, are you? Then again, you're not too quick on anything..
Say cheese for all my followers!
Ooh, sick death, dude!
I'm sorry about that, %name%. Get respawned so I can chase you down again!
You need to move faster that that, %name%. Cathook is power.
That looked like it hurt. But what a rush, am I right?
That sucks for you,%name%. But at least it wasn't boring.
That was crazy fun! Who's next?
That wasn't your life flashing before your eyes. That was me.
And that's what you get for trying to outrun me.
Oh, we should do that again! Only next time, even faster!
Why does it have to be over so soon?
Why so slow? Bad aimbot or something? I got Cathook that can fix that.
Wow, that was intense. Really makes me want to take a long pause and reflect and... no, I don't.
You can't outrun the Cattrain.
Man, you even die slow! Okay, hurry up, I have stuff to do.
Dude, you should totally go respawn so we can do that again.
You're quicker than I thought! Too bad I'm.. quicker-er.
Run fast, hit fast, win fast!
By the time you see me coming, I'll be going, and you'll be gone.
Its just a bad dream, it'll be over soon.
Have you said your goodbyes?
I look forward to meeting you all... real close and personal.
"If I can be honest, I just like the killing.
I just like watching skin suits suffer.
I wish there was more time to spend with you.'
I've seen the other side. There's nothing. You're nothing.
Go on. It's okay to be afraid.
You're just another mark on my list.
Just another worthless skin bag.
Your life won't flash before your eyes. It just ends.
Look into my eyes. I wanna remember this.
That little voice saying there's still hope? It's lying.
What made you think you were special?
Tell me. What'll you miss the most?
You can beg for mercy. It won't help, but go on.
You should've stayed home today.
You should thank me. You can rest now. (I never will.)
You were marked for death, you just didn't know it.
Now is when I wear your face as a mask.
I'm the nightmare."
This is what I was built for.
Time to have some fun.
They always get real quiet. Like they can hear me.
Being human is overrated.
One slice, stem to stern, it all spills out.
I did really good today. I can't wait to tell my creator. When I find him.
I won. Congratulations to me!
I'm sorry, but you could have killed me, friends.
Did you have as much fun as me? Hello?
Did you like my moves? My grapple is very useful.
Don't beat yourself up. Leave that to me! That was a joke!
Don't blame yourself, blame me!
Good work. Let's remain friends!
Cathook makes things much easier. Try it sometime!
Great moves, friend! Sorry, you lost.
Looks like I beat you. High five!
That was exciting. I hope you had fun!
I may win this thing today. Keep rooting for me!
I only beat you because I want to win.
It's okay, friend. I was just better this time.
I'll never forget this match. It's in my memory files.
Watch out. I'm very skilled with cathook.
If I didn't beat you, someone else could have.
If I had a heart, it would be racing right now.
You don't know where my creator is, do you?
If we were on the same team, you would be happy about this!
Look at that, I beat you!
Maybe next time you'll do really good.
You did a really mediocre job, friend!
My accuracy is getting better every day! Right?
Sorry I beat you. I'm only looking for my creator.
That was fun. Sorry, you died
Thank you for the fun fight!
That was close!
That was impressive. I hope my creator saw it.
The cathook developers love you! And they really love me.
This is my favorite part.
Some times luck is involved. But this time it was skill.
Cheating is 66.6% of the battle.
Now this is very fun when you win.
You tried and that's all that matters. Also winning.
You were tough, friend.
Don't worry, you won't be the only person I beat today.
I gotta admit... I MAY have tricked you. Phew, glad I got that off my chest.
Y'know I gotta admit... I may have tricked you. Glad I got that off my chest.
I gotcha.
Yeah. I gotcha
I gotta admit... I MAY have tricked you. Phew, glad I got that off my chest.
Y'know I gotta admit... I may have tricked you. Glad I got that off my chest.
I'm good! But, there's two of me. So I'm good twice! Check out that math.
I'm good, but there's two of me. So I'm good TWICE! Boom, check out that math
I'm good, I'm good. What can I say? Did I say I'm good? Well, I am.
I'm good, I'm good. What can I say? Did I say that I'm good 'cause... well, I am.
If you ever want tips, just give me a call!
It's not all that bad! I mean the suns out, it's a nice day, y' know... just trying to be hopeful.
It's not all that BAD, the suns out, it's a nice day... just trying to be hopeful.
This was just a LOVELY time, thank you for this.
This was... just a lovely time, thank you for this
Free tip, just try a little bit harder. You almost had it!
Free tip: Just try a little bit harder. Y'know you almost had it.
Trust me, losing ain't that bad. I mean you learn something new every time! 'Least... that's what I've been told. I wouldn't know what that's like.
Trust me, losing ain't that bad, you learn something new every time! At least... that's what I've been told.
I'll tell you this much, you did make me break a sweat. Little bit.
I'll tell you this much, you DID make me break a sweat.
No one had your back huh? I hate when that happens.
Not bad, if I didn't have to kill ya, I'd hire ya.
You lost this one. But it has nothing to do with your skills! Well-- 'cause you don't have any, I mean clearly.
Yeah, you lost this one, but it has nothing to do with your skills! 'Cause—well—I mean you don't have any, clearly.
Ah, boy, this... was rough for you. Ah, next time maybe.
Ooh boy, this was rough for you! Ah, next time maybe.
Well. This is... one way to make memories.
Well this is ONE way to make memories!
You can't take this personally, it's just business. Personal business.
You can't take this personally, it's just business! Personal... business
I'm proud to have fought with you. I mean, seriously! I-- I mean it. (aside) Why doesn't anyone believe me...?
I'm proud to have fought with you! I'm serious. I-- I mean it. No one ever believes me!
Quite the predemis--! Predah—Predepicatio—Predi—Predicamina? It's a bad situation.
Wow, that's quite the predemis—Pruh—Preh... Predicam—uh... It's a bad situation for you.
Listen, quitting is for losers and since... you already lost, well there's... really no point in giving up now.
Listen, quitting is for losers! And since you already lost I mean there's... no point in giving up now.
Hey, sometimes you lose... Sometimes you're me.
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you're me.
I'm so sorry to make you wait. I meant to beat you much faster.
I'm so sorry to make you wait, I--I mean to beat you... much faster!
Oh sorry, did I confuse you?
Sorry, did I confuse you?
You gotta take the good, with the bad. I'm good, you're bad.
You gotta take the good with the bad! I'm good, and—you're bad.
Hey, thank you for this. I feel much better about myself now.
Thank you for this, I feel MUCH better about myself now.
Wasn't the thrill of victory in itself, really? Yeah, probably not.
Wasn't the thrill of victory in itself? Eh, probably not, you're dead.
Until we meet again, buddy.
Until we meet again, buddy!
We had fun! ...Right? I mean I had fun.
Hey, we had fun. Right?
Listen, you chose to fight me. Or... maybe was it the other way around? Ah, whatever, I won.
Listen, you chose to fight me. Or... maybe was it the other way around? Oh well! I won.
Hey, you did good! I think you did good, I mean... Well maybe not THAT good, after all... I mean... Look at you. Heh. Okay, bye!
Hey, you did good. I think you did good, I mean, well—maybe not that good after all... considering... okay, goodbye.
You got bamboozled!
YOU, got bamboozled!
If you ask me, you weren't... half bad. That means... you were half good!
You know, if you ask me, you weren't half bad. Hey! That means you were half good!
Okay, I'll be nice. You weren't... too bad. There. I said it. You're welcome.
Okay, I'll be nice. You weren't too bad. There, I said it. You're welcome.
This is how it goes: You win, you lose, you die, y--... you know, I guess that's it.
Alright, this is how it goes. You win, you lose, you die, y--... I guess that's it, really.
GET GOOD,GET LMAOBOX
Get ready! I'm coming for you, friend.
In case you didn't know, you get here by winning. Good luck
I am really good at this. You should be too.
I swung to this position. Funny and true!
I'll high five you all when I see you.
I'm excited to fight you!
Oh, am I supposed to talk?
This sounds like it'll be fun.
This will be fun. Can't wait to win!
After this, we should hang out!
Wow! They chose me! The odds are full of all kinds of math.
What haunts you most is death. Something you no longer need to fear.
The Allfather has gifted me with the better strength.
imagine if the caber did like 600 damage but always killed its user unless they're ubered
I just god 2 notifications from youtube and discord while I was in game
I'm the nightmare.
I'm the nightmare.
Team looks good. It'll do nicely as shields.
All these skinbags ready to die.
I hope they run. I like when they run.
This is what I was built for.
Time to add names to my list.
The only thing that matters is body count.
Their final moments give me life.
Wait until they meet me.
They still think this is a game. It's not.
Fear is my currency.
They only think they know what fear is.
I don't do this for fame or glory, I do it for fun.
They made me a killing machine.
They made me a killing machine. Who am I to argue with programming?
This gives me purpose.
Time to have some fun.
They always get real quiet. Like they can hear me.
I used to wear a skinsuit too.
Being human is overrated.
One slice, stem to stern, it all spills out.
You all think you'll make it out of this one alive... (laughs)
Have you said your goodbyes?
I look forward to meeting you all... real close and personal.
Look at all the skin suits... they don't stand a chance.
You've all been marked for death.
Don't bother trying to find me. I'll find you.
Ever get the feeling you're not alone in the room? You're not.
Get a good look. It's the last time you'll see me.
I don't need souvenirs. Every scream is encoded, stored forever.
I plan on getting under your skin.
You already know: I'm gonna kill you today.
I'm not gonna make it quick. That would spoil all the fun.
Last group of legends I slaughtered looked hopeful too.
Like cattle being herded into the slaughterhouse.
You're all like lambs to a slaughter. And I'm the butcher.
Look at all the new additions to my list.
First is looting, but then comes my favorite part: the screaming.
[sniffs] That's the sweet aroma of fear.
There's still time to run.
Now you will understand why you fear the dark.
Your championships are as meaningless as you are.
What's your costume? Sub-average intelligence?
You're about to face the longest winter of them all.
I observe the field from a plateau you cannot even comprehend.
Accept the process. It is, after all, well tested.
Another trial, another test subject.
Being fundamentally better sours the taste of victory.
You made an attempt on my life. Brave, perhaps, but ill conceived.
Death is a paradoxical quest. It ends, but never truly begins.
Don't look for sympathy. You won't find it.
Humanity. It's just a word.
I don't consider death cruel, but life... (coughs)
I thank you.
It's simple really. (coughs) I'm just better than you.
In the end, everything dies.
It's a miraculous thing.
Just a taste is all you need.
Know your place, (coughs) at the bottom of the food chain.
Life ends with death. I am simply expediting the process.
My intelligence should not be underestimated.
(Laughs) "One more.
In the end, one's life is measured by those we've changed."
Science demands a repeatable outcome to any given experiment. Hence why I am here, and you are there.
Remarkable. Simply remarkable.
Some compounds are inert, having little to no effect on the outcome... Like you.
Take notes. I am.
I don't concern myself with the ambitions of insects.
The biggest trap is your own mind.
The distance between life and death is measured by suffering.
The rabbit's cries bring the wolves.
The results have come in. You lose.
In time, the strong will filter out the weak.
To say your death is a waste is the understatement of the century.
There is a process to everything, and also a conclusion. This is yours.
This is my favorite part.
This was a failure... for one of us.
This was an inevitable outcome.
Victory is delicious.
Without pain, the body suffers in silence, omitting the entertainment.
Take comfort in the fact you are now a part of something grander.
You thought we were equals. Foolish.
You're welcome.
Perhaps if I wasn't one of the variables, your outcome would have been different.
I must confess, your skills were inadequate.
Cold out? Gonna feel a lot colder in a second.
Looks like aiming isn't your strong suit.
Bad effect on target, rook.
On this field you gotta be prepared for anything.
You can't dodge heavy artillery. You know that right?
Did you think the trigger would pull itself?
Don't knock yourself. I put my time in long ago.
Dropped, shocked, and rocked. Say hello to the four-oh first.
First one through the door is usually the first one in a body bag.
Good initiative, bad judgment. Try again.
I got the best of you today.
Here's a tip: know what you're doing.
You need to hit the range more.
Ever heard of a stock? Barrel stabilizer? How about skills? You might wanna find you some.
Not gonna say this was too easy, but I may have had one eye closed.
I said danger close. Weren't you listening?
I'm quicker than you think. Keep that in mind next time.
You're just another KIA on my resume.
You sure you didn't just make it out of basic training?
Kill confirmed. Gonna add you to the list.
Like a deer in the headlights. And I'm the headlights.
No substitute for real steel.
You're not even worth the chalk to tally.
Not your day, shooter.
You played dead like a pro.
Rate of fire means nothing when you miss all the time.
What happened? Recoil hit you in the face?
[sniffs] So that's what fear smells like.
Take a breather. You lost this one.
First you lose your cool, then you lose your head.
Too slow on the draw.
Training dummies move faster than you.
What are you? The FNG?
What happened? Your weapon malfunction? Or did you?
This is what happens when your unit goes AWOL.
You just got caught on the wrong end of my muzzle.
I can tell from your shooting that you ain't no operator.
You bleed. You sweat. You get what you put in.
I'm gonna give you the bottom line upfront: You lost this one.
You shooting blanks, or you just miss a lot?
Don't matter who you were back in the world. You're in my house now
Big, small, don't matter. You're just target practice to me.
Show up on my door playing pretend soldier? Hmph, here's your candy.
Better find me before I find you.
Come get some. Move it or die.
Get ready for a light show.
No such thing as auto-aim, ladies.
You make contact, you better finish the job.
Season 1 Battle Pass "Opening season. No time for an FNG.
This isn't a costume, it's a uniform. It's who I am and you will respect it.
They say there's nothing harsher than a long winter, guess they never met me.
Artillery sounds like music to me.
I'm not hard to understand. Death is my language.
Don't bring a pistol to an artillery fight.
Don't matter what you run, just how you use it.
Don't miss. I won't.
Get ready for a world of hurt.
Want a tip? Go back to boot camp.
Heads up for a pucker factor.
Pistols to artillery, I can do it all, your call.
Name the weapon, I'll still beat you.
I'm ready today... (laughs) I'm ready all month.
Locked and loaded.
Make each round count.
Maybe this time I'll open both eyes.
Shooter ready
Brush it off. Ya lost this one.
They don't just call me Lifeline because I save a life...
Don't blame yourself. You got a whole squad that failed you.
This skill takes experience and strength. I have both.
Giving up is no thing I will do.
Dis good for ya.
Good match!
I came to win. You didn't.
I had a job to do.
Don't be shocked. I know what I'm doin'.
I won this one.
Member this: I'm the one you should have concerns about.
It's a big up feelin' to win.
It's all skill.
It's just a loss. Take it.
Breathe easy. It's over for you.
You listen to me. It's over.
Losing, that's a drag.
Never quit. That's how you win.
Next time. Next time you'll do better.
Nuh romp wid mi. Not today.
No support? That's a shame.
Not your day.
In the future, pay more attention. It'll do you good.
Quit your whinging.
Take this as motivation. Be better.
Take this loss with pride.
Thank you. You made me just a little bit better.
This is just how it is.
This is my win, 'member that.
This is not my first time.
Use the pressure. It's the only way to survive.
Come on, use your head.
What happens to you happens to you. That's good for you.
Winning, now that's a good feelin'.
You're gonna need to work a bit harder next time.
Breathe easy. You lost this one.
You lost. Take it.
Your skill wasn't half bad! 'Member that.
Your team let you down, bredren.
Your time has ended.
Check yo self - or wreck yo self. (laugh)
Small up yuhself. Ajay Che's comin' through.
Bring it. Ajay Che will be waitin' for ya down there.
I'd watch out for my squad if I were you.
Quit ya whinging and fight.
Ya bet' not romp with me.
Accept it! I'm here, you're not.
Ain't afraid of you, ya hear me?
Mi deh yah. All good for me.
Ya better hope you're with me.
Don't worry, it's easy. Bleed, patch, and keep moving.
Champion, challenger, means little if ya die.
A win don't come easy. For you.
I've seen it all. Today, no different.
You're lookin' at a fighter. What am I lookin' at?
Move it or quit.
Member this face. It's comin' for ya.
Want advice? Stay out of my way.
It takes a lot to take me out.
Wanna be here? Take me out.
[chuckles] Ya ain't that bright if ya wanna take me on.
Breathe easy, watch your side, and never quit.
Get ready... today's not gon' be easy.
Go on, try to stop me!
You and me, let's take this win.
Come on, we've got work to do.
We've got a job to do, so shift your carcass.
I'm ready. Let's get the job done.
This is gonna be a good fight."
It's time to impress.
Nuh romp wid mi. I'm ready for a match.
Mi deh yah. All good wit me.
Ready to go, seen?
Mi ain't afraid of much but losing? That would be a drag.
I got your back. Memba mi tell yu.
We're in this together. Memba that.
If you're with me, I'm with you.
Pay attention. Ya might learn a thing or two.
Big things are comin' for us.
This place is somethin' else. Let's go!
It's only over when it's over.
You know what I look like - come find me.
Follow my path to win.
I don't fear anything. Can you say the same?
Pain... death... nothing phases me.
Try not to blink, you may miss me.
There's a thin line between life and death. You can find me there.
I'll travel every road, kick down every door, till I get what I want.
You think it's cold? Spend time in The Void. You'll know what's cold.
Just a step in the right direction.
Another day, another road.
Every decision counts.
Good choice... for me.
I saw this coming.
I'll take you down more than once.
I'm here today... let's do this.
I'm quick, and I'll finish this.
I've been here before.
It's my turn this time.
I know more than you'll never know.
You don't get here by sitting around doing nothing.
Something wrong with your head if you fight me.
Trust just your eyes and you'll lose.
Wanna win? Do what I do.
I don't relish the title... I relish the kill.
It all ends the same way... with me observing.

I find these insipid celebrations of the macabre... amusing.
